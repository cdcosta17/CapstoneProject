# CapstoneProject

The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that has been built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. This project contains:

- A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word. This can be viewed [here](https://cdcosta17.shinyapps.io/Prediction/)
- A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter pitching the algorithm and app. This can be viewed [here](http://rpubs.com/cdcosta17/PredictionSlideDeck)

This repo also contains all the files necessary to reproduce the project on your own.
- The data for this project is available from: <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip>
- The code for the shiny app can be found in the Prediction folder.
- ```dataprep.R``` contains the code to extract and prepare the data to be used with the prediction model.
